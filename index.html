        Monster Hunter
      </header>
      <p>Monster Hunter <code>(モンスターハンター, Monsutā Hantā)</code> is a Japanese media franchise centered around a
        series of fantasy-themed action role-playing video games that started with the game Monster Hunter for
        the PlayStation 2, released in 2004. Titles have been released across a variety of platforms, including
        personal computers, home consoles, portable consoles, and mobile devices. The series is developed and
        published by Capcom.</p>
      <p>The games are primarily action role-playing games. The player takes the role of a Hunter, slaying or
        trapping large monsters across various landscapes as part of quests given to them by locals, with some
        quests involving the gathering of a certain item or items, which may put the Hunter at risk of facing
        various monsters. As part of its core gameplay loop, players use loot gained from slaying monsters,
        gathering resources, and quest rewards to craft improved weapons, armor, and other items that allow them
        to face more powerful monsters. All main series titles feature multiplayer (usually up to four players
        cooperatively), but can also be played single player.</p>
      <p>As of September 30, 2022, the game series has sold 88 million units worldwide, and is Capcom's second
        best-selling series following <code>Resident Evil</code>. The early games in the series principally sold
        well in
        Japan and other Asian countries, popularized by the series' use of ad hoc multiplayer features on
        portable consoles. Monster Hunter has been critically well-received in Western markets, but had
        generally languished in sales, in part due to the game's steep learning curve. However, with <code>Monster
          Hunter: World (2018)</code>, Capcom aimed to attract a global audience using the power of advanced home
        gaming
        consoles and computers and released the title simultaneously worldwide. World became the best-selling
        Monster Hunter game within three days of its release, and became Capcom's single best-selling video game
        of all time with 21 million sales as of July 5, 2022, including more than 70% outside of Japan.</p>

        Setting
      </header>
      <p>Monster Hunter takes place in a shared low fantasy setting, where the human-like species have a
        pre-industrial level of technology such as steam power, but continue to study the ruins of a long-past
        advanced civilization. In the setting's less populated regions, monsters roam the landscape and threaten
        small villages or research bases that have been established to study the ruins and these monsters.
        Players take the role of a Hunter that serves to help protect the villages and bases from these
        monsters, typically aiding in researching these.</p>

        Gameplay
      </header>
      <p>The core feature of Monster Hunter is its compulsion loop. Unlike traditional computer role-playing
        games, a player's Hunter does not grow and has no intrinsic statistics or attributes whatsoever. Rather,
        the Hunter's abilities are instead defined by the specific weapons and armor selected. The player can
        equip weapons, armor, and items most beneficial towards completing a given mission, and if successful,
        the Hunter is awarded in both in-game money ("zenny") and loot representing parts from the monster.
        These parts, along with other resources collected while on missions or through mission rewards, can be
        used to forge or upgrade new weapons and armor which then can be used in against more powerful monsters
        and tackle more difficult missions, completing the compulsion loop. Harder missions are typically
        restricted by a hunter's rank, which cumulatively increases as the player completes specific missions
        designated by the quest giver. Mission rewards are often generated randomly, often requiring the player
        to grind the same monster repeatedly to get the right parts. Weapons and armor have intrinsic bonuses or
        penalties towards certain types of elemental or physical damages, and may provide special skills which
        can be fine-tuned through the mix-and-matching of equipment pieces.</p>
      <p>The games feature a variety of different weapon classes, ranging from swords, hammers, and bows, with the
        most recent titles (Generations, World, and Rise) having a total of fourteen classes. Each weapon class
        has a unique set of combat maneuvers and reflect a number of different play styles based on speed of
        attack, damage strength, range and the application of buffs and debuffs to monsters and allies. Monster
        Hunter games use an "animation priority" combat, committing the player to a move until the animation is
        completed and leaving them potentially vulnerable to a monster's attack. Further, players are encouraged
        to watch their Hunter's health and stamina. Losing all health will force a retreat to a base camp, and
        after three such retreats, the mission is deemed a failure. Performing most combat actions consumes
        stamina, which recovers in a short amount of time; once exhausted of stamina, the Hunter becomes
        vulnerable as they pause to catch their breath. Monsters and other environmental hazards can also
        inflict blights and other negative status effects that impair combat abilities. Combat is centered
        around watching for a monster's tells prior to an attack to be able to dodge it and/or make a
        counterattack, and looking for openings to unleash strings of attack combos, depending on the Hunter's
        current weapon. Unlike most other action games, Monster Hunter fights have been compared to a series of
        boss fights.</p>
      <p>Nearly all Monster Hunter games have a single-player mode; in these, the Hunter is often accompanied by a
        Felyne or Palico, a sentient cat-like creature that provides support and limited offensive abilities in
        combat. Most Monster Hunter games released with support for four-player cooperative online modes,
        allowing the group to hunt down stronger versions of monsters, though this support has since been
        disabled in older games. The games typically have a main quest line, frequently called "Low Rank" or
        "Village Quests", which can take up to fifty hours to complete. Once completed, the game opens up with
        new "High Rank" or "Gathering Hall" quests, featuring stronger versions of monsters they have previously
        faced, as well as new monsters are yet seen and unique variants of these foes, all of which provide
        better components for more powerful weapons and armor sets, providing hundreds of hours of potential
        gameplay following the main quest. Most, if not all titles have a third rank of difficulty ("G Rank" or
        "Master Rank"), released after the base game. These add more monsters, locations, weapons and armour
        sets to the game.</p>

        History
      </header>
      <p>The first Monster Hunter game was one of three titles <code>Capcom</code> had developed to take advantage
        of the
        processing power and online capabilities of the PlayStation 2, which according to Ryozo Tsujimoto, who
        has been the series' producer since Monster Hunter Freedom 2, had begun to match arcade games in
        capabilities; the other two such titles were Auto Modellista and Resident Evil Outbreak. Tsujimoto
        considered Monster Hunter to be the culmination of the work of these other two titles once it was
        released. He also felt that the game was intended for such cooperative play so that players of any skill
        level, working with others, could feel accomplished in taking down giant creatures. Monster Hunter
        proved a success, selling over 1 million copies, principally in Japan. Enhanced versions of the early
        games, adding more difficult monsters and end-game quests, were released with a "G" affixed to the end
        (such as Monster Hunter G for the first such game); for those titles that were released in Western
        regions, these were often, though not always, affixed with the Ultimate moniker. A second team worked to
        develop a series for the PlayStation Portable. These games often had a more lighthearted tone and
        expanded upon the palicoe system. In Japan, these games were released under the "Portable" title, while
        in the west they were released under the "Freedom" title. Even after these naming conventions were
        abandoned, this established the general tradition of one team releasing games for home consoles and a
        separate team releasing a portable game a few years later.</p>
      <p>The series took off explosively in Japan with Monster Hunter G and Monster Hunter Portable/Freedom on the
        PlayStation Portable and even more so once its sequels Monster Hunter Dos, Monster Hunter Portable
        2nd/Freedom 2 and Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G/Freedom Unite were released which supported up to four
        players. Handheld systems are generally more popular in Japan and due to the country's high population
        density, it was easy to find players to hunt cooperatively with, making it a phenomenon there. James
        Miekle, writing for PC Gamer, had worked for Q Entertainment and lived in Japan during the release of
        Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, which was the best selling PlayStation Portable game of all time and
        described how even during work, impromptu Monster Hunter sessions would break out between employees and
        there was extensive marketing of Monster Hunter branded consumer goods.</p>
      <p>While Monster Hunter had been successful in Japan, its popularity in Western markets (primarily North
        America and Europe) languished. In contrast to the Japanese culture, Western markets favored home
        consoles and computers during the mid-2000s and because of a thinner population density, most players
        relied on Internet-based gaming rather than local ad hoc networking. The series also struggled with a
        difficult learning curve that had made the games off-putting in Western markets.</p>
      <p>The series had little popularity in the West until the release of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the
        <code>Nintendo 3DS</code>, a console that had gained a sizable foothold in Western markets. While
        Monster Hunter's
        popularity in the West was still to a niche group, Capcom saw the potential for more growth there and
        took steps to better localize the next few titles to make the series more attractive; Monster Hunter 4
        was the first game in the series to break one million sales in Western markets. Capcom recognized there
        was still room for further growth of the series there; in an October 2016 interview, Capcom chairman
        Kenzo Tsujimoto said they were looking towards increasing the popularity of the games in the Western
        markets, recognizing that gaming consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have dominance in these
        regions over handhelds. Monster Hunter: World, the series's first major entry targeting home consoles
        and computers, was developed to be more alluring for Western markets without trying to make the game
        simpler. A number of changes in gameplay were made that took advantage of the consoles' new technology;
        notably, while the prior games had split each hunting area into different zones as necessitated by
        limits of the console hardware, World's used seamless zones and several changes to gameplay were made to
        account for this. World became the series' best selling game, achieving more than 21 million units sold
        by 2022 and making the Monster Hunter series Capcom's best-selling series following Resident Evil.
